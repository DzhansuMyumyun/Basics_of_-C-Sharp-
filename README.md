# Intro C#
🔍 __Discover C# Fundamentals__: Entities, Classes, Conditions, Loops, Inheritance, OOP, Polymorphism, dependency injection, and Basics

This repository is your gateway to mastering the essential elements of C# programming, including inheritance, object-oriented programming (OOP), polymorphism, and dependency injection. 


🔹 __inheritance__: In C#, inheritance enables a class (derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (base class). Syntax-wise, you use a colon (:) after the derived class name followed by the base class name. This promotes code reuse and allows for creating class hierarchies. You can override base class members in the derived class using the override keyword and access base class members using the base keyword.

🔹 __Object-oriented programming (OOP)__ in C# revolves around classes and objects. Here's a concise overview:

🏗️ __Classes__: Blueprints for objects, defining their properties and behaviors.

🔧 __Objects__: Instances of classes, created using the new keyword.

🔒 __Encapsulation__: Bundling data and methods within a class, controlling access with modifiers like public and private.

🔗 __Inheritance__: Creating new classes (derived) based on existing ones (base), inheriting their properties and behaviors.

🔄 __Polymorphism__: Treating objects of different classes through a common interface, achieved via method overriding and overloading.

These concepts help in creating organized, reusable, and maintainable code in C#.




📚 __What's Inside__:

__1.Entities__: Learn how to model real-world entities within your programs, encapsulating both data and behavior to create scalable and organized code structures.

__2.Classes__: Delve into the world of object-oriented programming as you master the principles of classes, including abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, to build robust software architectures.

__3.Conditions & Loops__: Explore the intricacies of control flow with a detailed examination of conditionals and loops. Understand how to manipulate program execution paths efficiently to solve a wide range of problems.

__4.Back to Basics__: Revisit the fundamental building blocks of programming, covering variables, data types, operators, and functions. Strengthen your coding proficiency by honing your understanding of these core concepts.


🌟 __Structured Learning__: This repository provides a systematic approach to learning C# fundamentals, including inheritance, OOP, and polymorphism.
