# Intro C#

🌟 __Structured Learning__: This repository is your gateway to mastering the essential elements of C# programming, including entities, classes, conditions, loops, inheritance, object-oriented programming (OOP), polymorphism, and dependency injection. 


📚 __What's Inside__:

__1.Entities__: Learn how to model real-world entities within your programs, encapsulating both data and behavior to create scalable and organized code structures.

__2.Classes__: Delve into the world of object-oriented programming as you master the principles of classes, including abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, to build robust software architectures.

__3.Conditions & Loops__: Explore the intricacies of control flow with a detailed examination of conditionals and loops. Understand how to manipulate program execution paths efficiently to solve a wide range of problems.

__4.Back to Basics__: Revisit the fundamental building blocks of programming, covering variables, data types, operators, and functions. Strengthen your coding proficiency by honing your understanding of these core concepts.


🔹 __Object-oriented programming (OOP)__ in C# revolves around classes and objects. Here's a concise overview:

🏗️ __Classes__: Blueprints for objects, defining their properties and behaviors.

🔧 __Objects__: Instances of classes, created using the new keyword.

🔒 __Encapsulation__: Bundling data and methods within a class, controlling access with modifiers like public and private.

🔗 __Inheritance__: Creating new classes (derived) based on existing ones (base), inheriting their properties and behaviors.

🔄 __Polymorphism__: Treating objects of different classes through a common interface, achieved via method overriding and overloading.

These concepts help in creating organized, reusable, and maintainable code in C#.
